# Two Types
1. Time complexity
2. Memory complexity
Goal is to minimise both...
# Big O Notation (time complexity)
Measure of worst case performance.
> A function f(n) is said to be O(g(n)) if there exists an n_o such that f(n) <= c * g(n) for all n >= n_o.
> O(g(n)) = { *f(n):* there exist positive constants c and n_0 such that *0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n)* for *all n ≥ n_0 }*

Question : Check if a given integer is present in an array
```C
int check(int *arr, int size, int n){
	for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
		if(arr[i] == x);
		return 1;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
Here the computation if this program is dependent on `size`.
> Omega(1) <= f(size) <= O(size)

> **Omega notation** represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the **best-case** complexity of an algorithm.
> **Ω(g(n))** = { **f(n):** there exist positive constants c and n0 such that ****0 ≤ cg(n) ≤ f(n)**** for all n ≥ n0 }

Best case : 1 comparison
Worst case : `size` times comparisons

Here the time complexity is O(size)...
For example in 2 nested for loops each running n times, the complexity is O(n^2).
###### TC for binary search
Since we search only half of the sorted array.
> f(n) = f(n/2) + O(1)
> On solving ... f(n) = log_2 (n)
